---EXPLORING ANIMAL HEALTH DATA FOR *DOMESTIC* ANIMALS SINCE 2005
---DATA RETRIEVED FROM OIE-WAHIS (WORLD ANIMAL HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEM)
---ON 01/12/2022

---SKILLS USED: AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS, WINDOW FUNCTIONS, CTE, SUBQUERIES, CASE STATEMENT
-- GO TO PART B-V OR LINE 113 TO SEE ALL BUT 1 OF THESE SKILLS USED IN ONE QUERY
		
---A. SETTING THINGS UP

--I. IN THIS DATA SET:
	--i. THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE NUMBER OF DEATHS(KILLED, SLAUGHTERED AND DICEASED COMBINED)
	-- FAR EXCEEDS NUMBER OF CASES
--II. FOR THAT, WE HAVE:
	--1. ADDED A NEW COLUMN CALLED NEW_CASES BASED ON THE
	-- ASSUMPTION THAT THE TRUE CASE NUMBERS SHOULD BE AT LEAST >= 
	-- NUMBERS OF DEATHS(KILLED, SLAUGHTERED AND DICEASED COMBINED)

--III. ADDING COLUMN NEW_CASES, THEN INSERT THE TRUE CASES VALUES INTO IT

	ALTER TABLE ANIMAL_HEALTH_REPORT
	ADD NEW_CASES FLOAT;
			
	UPDATE ANIMAL_HEALTH_REPORT
	SET NEW_CASES =
		CASE
			WHEN CASES < KILLED_AND_DISPOSED_OF + SLAUGHTERED + DEATHS 
			THEN KILLED_AND_DISPOSED_OF + SLAUGHTERED + DEATHS
			ELSE CASES
		END;
